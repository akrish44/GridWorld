Set 1 Questions:

1) No, the bug does not always move to a new location, because if it is entirely surrounded by rocks, it will not be able to keep moving.

2) The bug always moves in straight until a rock comes in its way and prevents it from moving any further. When this happens, the bug continues to move clockwise until its path is free.

3) If the bug does not move, it will turn at a 45 degree angle until it is able to move again.
4) When a bug moves, it leaves a flower behind in its path, which gets darker as the bug continues to move.

5)When the bug is at the edge of the grid, it will turn at a 45 degree angle until it is able to run again. When the bug is facing some other direction, it will continue to move as long as its path is not blocked.

6) When a bug has a rock located immediately in front of it, it will move at a 45 degree angle clockwise until it can move again.

7) A flower does not move, because they mark where the bug has been. However, they change colors according to how many times a bug has passed that flower.

8) The only behavior a flower has is changing colors based on how many times the bug passes it.

9) A rock does not move and it does not have any behavior. It just remains stationary.

10) A bug and a rock can be in the same location, but a rock and a bug or a rock and a flower cannot be in the same location, because the rock acts as an obstacle, so the bug runs around it.


Exercises:

1)  0: North
	45: Northeast
	90: East
	135: Southeast
	180: South
	225: Southwest
	270: West
	315: Northwest
	360: North

2) The bug can move in any direction and you can move it until there is an obstacle in its path. If you try to move the bug outside the grid, it will turn at 45 degree angles until it's facing the inside of the grid.

3) To change the color of a bug, flower, or a rock, I used the setColor method.

4) When you move a rock on top of a bug and then move the rock again, the bug disappears.
