1) The CircleBug actor does not make a square shape like the BoxBug actor does, because instead of turning at 90 degree angles, it turns at 45 degree angles.

5) To add another BoxBug to the grid, you would have to add it to the main method in the BoxBugRunner class. This would be your new main method:

You would then have to place that boxBug inside GridWorld by adding a location to it or giving it a random location.

public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ActorWorld world = new ActorWorld();
        BoxBug alice = new BoxBug(6);
        alice.setColor(Color.ORANGE);
        BoxBug bob = new BoxBug(3);
        BoxBug steven = new BoxBug(4);
        world.add(new Location(7, 8), alice);
        world.add(new Location(5, 5), bob);
        world.add(new Location(3, 8), steven);
        world.show();
    }
